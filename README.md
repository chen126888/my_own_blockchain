This project is based on the Udemy course "Learn Blockchain By Building Your Own In JavaScript."
I followed the course to build a minimalist blockchain system and made a few customizations:

Block generation difficulty has been intentionally lowered to reduce the waiting time during testing.

Basic test cases have been added to verify core functionalities.

Additional features are planned for future development.

This project serves as a lightweight introduction to how blockchain works under the hood, and is intended for educational and prototyping purposes.
